# Warning
# Server-sent events do not work with Flask’s built-in development server,
# because it handles HTTP requests one at a time. The SSE stream is intended to
# be an infinite stream of events, so it will never complete. If you try to run
# this code on with the built-in development server, the server will be unable
# to take any other requests once you connect to this stream.  Instead, you must
# use a web server with asychronous workers. Gunicorn can work with gevent to
# use asychronous workers: see gunicorn’s design documentation.


gunicorn --workers=2 'app:create_app()'
gunicorn --bind=localhost:5000 --workers=2 'app:create_app()'


Run your code using gunicorn’s gevent workers:

gunicorn --worker-class gevent --bind 127.0.0.1:8000 wsgi
