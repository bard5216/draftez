1. mysqlclient - require mysqlclient c library.
2. MySQLdb is a thin python wrapper around C module which implements API for MySQL database.
3. mysql-python doesn't support Python3 but is promising it soon (May 2020)
4. pymsql is a pure python driver. Has fewest dependencies.
5. mysq-connector-python is pure sql and written by MySQL. Slowest.
