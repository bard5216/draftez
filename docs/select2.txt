bower install select2

With a bower config file, bower packages are by default installed to src/components/

select2 has thus been installed to <project-dir>/src/src/components/select2
The dist parts in dist/js and dist/css under the component's install dir.

Should use flask-assets to copy those files to the appropriate directory.
